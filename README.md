# Trie-Implementation
This is my implementation and usage of a trie data structure for a college assignment

This trie implementation is versitile and can be used to store any kind of data. 
It is limited to lower case letters only. 
It features a callback function for dealocating the stored data when freeing the structure. 

In the future I hope to implement the radix optimization and make it more versitile by being able to use more than only lowercase letters
